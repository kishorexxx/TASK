HTTP/1.1:
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
It works on the textual format.
It compresses data itself.

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
It works on the binary protocol.
